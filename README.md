For better helping people learn a new language. Initially working on a French to English app but will explore if it can be generalised to any set of languages.

The first step would be to come up with a program to translate each given french word into english. This is pretty rudimentary. I think OpenAI integration is definitely where the project is headed.

The end goal is to input a french text document and come up with a type of file that has an underline under each word, hovering over which we can see what the word means in English. Also for each text document created, we can analyse the sentence structures and add notes for the user on French Grammar and common mistakes to avoid etc etc.
