For better helping people learn a new language. Initially working on a French to English app but will explore if it can be generalised to any set of languages.

The first step would be to come up with a program to translate each given french word into english. This is pretty rudimentary. I think OpenAI integration is definitely where the project is headed.

The end goal is to input a french text document and come up with a type of file that has an underline under each word, hovering over which we can see what the word means in English. Also for each text document created, we can analyse the sentence structures and add notes for the user on French Grammar and common mistakes to avoid etc etc.

Game plan:

1. **Text Input and Processing:**
   - Allow users to input French text or upload documents.
   - Convert the text to include underlined words or phrases that can be hovered over.

2. **Translation:**
   - Implement word-to-word translations using a dictionary API.
   - Provide full sentence and paragraph translations for context.

3. **Hover Feature:**
   - When users hover over underlined text, display the English translation in a tooltip.
   - Optionally, allow clicking on the word for more detailed information.

4. **Grammar Notes:**
   - Include relevant grammar notes and explanations based on the text being read.
   - Highlight grammatical constructs and provide examples.

5. **User Interface:**
   - Simple and intuitive interface for ease of use.
   - Options for customizing the display (e.g., font size, colors).

6. **Additional Features:**
   - Save and load reading sessions.
   - Track progress and vocabulary.
   - Integration with existing language learning tools (e.g., flashcards, quizzes).

# Rough plan for building the app:

### 1. Frontend Development
- Use a framework like React for building the user interface.
- Implement text input and display areas.
- Implement hover functionality using CSS and JavaScript.

### 2. Backend Development
- Set up a server using Node.js or Python (Flask/Django).
- Integrate translation APIs (e.g., Google Translate API).
- Store grammar notes and rules in a database.

### 3. Translation and Grammar Features
- Use translation APIs for real-time translation.
- Develop a grammar rules engine that can provide notes based on the text.

### 4. Testing and Iteration
- Test the app with different texts and get user feedback.
- Iterate on the design and functionality based on feedback.

### Example Workflow:

1. **User Input:**
   - User inputs or uploads a French text.
2. **Text Processing:**
   - The app processes the text and identifies words/phrases for translation.
3. **Display:**
   - The app displays the French text with underlined words/phrases.
4. **Hover Interaction:**
   - User hovers over underlined text to see the English translation.
5. **Grammar Notes:**
   - Relevant grammar notes are displayed alongside or after the text.

### Tools and Technologies:
- **Frontend:** React, HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend:** Node.js with Express, or Python with Flask/Django
- **APIs:** Google Translate API, or similar translation service
- **Database:** MongoDB, PostgreSQL, or another suitable database
