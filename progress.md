# Plan
* Build the backend first. Look up MongoDB and come up with the necessary database design. Use French APIs for translating given sentences from French to English.
* For the frontend, the basic wireframes you drew are enough to being with.
* Figure out the necessary steps to complete building the backend.
* Begin with a program to convert the given French text into English, also provide each word translations(this could be a dictionary with keys being the French words and the values being the English words).
